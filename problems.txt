This currently has some problems:
    Error messages are pretty much non-existent
        Basically create error_handling.h or something like that
    Some other things, look for todos and fixme's
    Add link-time function checking
    Add branching
    Add expressions
    Add typechecking to reflection functions, maybe?
    Add API instead of raw reflection and runtime passing
